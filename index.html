            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, welcome to my webpage. 
		I am Rahul Kulkarni, a final year BS-MS student at the Indian Insitute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Bhopal in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                My primary research interest is in Autonomous Systems and Robotics, particularly in Design, Control and Path Planning of Autonomous Drones in the realm of Marine and Aerial robotics. I am also keen in working on interdisciplinary problems and application of Smart Systems in multi-disciplinary research like Hydrology and Disaster Mitigation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently a researcher (2023 - Present) in Multi Robot Autonomy Lab (MOON Lab) at the dept of EECS in IISER Bhopal, where I am also doing my MS thesis on "Design and Control of Hybrid Cycloidal Propeller Drone". I was also the SPARK Research Fellow (Summer 2023) at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee.
